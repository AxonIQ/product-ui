# @core package

This is the @core package, containing core AxonIQ components, built with Svelte, that should be used across all AxonIQ frontend implementations.

If you want to see how these components look locally, please go to the [@style-guide](https://github.com/AxonIQ/product-ui/tree/master/packages/style-guide) package, and run the dev build.
